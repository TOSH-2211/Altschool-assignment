<!--My biography-->
   <h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
     I've always been curious about what goes on behind the scenes of platforms like Google.Who builds them and how they work. Although I’ve had a strong interest in computers for a long time but never had the opportunity to receive formal training. 
That changed when my amazing brother introduced me to AltSchool Africa. I’m hopeful that this marks the beginning of an exciting and fulfilling journey for me.
My goal is to become a skilled frontend developer. With guidance and clear explanations from the LMS and my instructors, I’m confident that I’ll gain the knowledge and hands-on experience needed to grow in this field.
</p>

<!--REASON FOR JOINING ALTSCHOOL AFRICA-->
<h2> Reason behind joining AltSchool</h2>
<p>
    I joined the AltSchool School of Engineering to gain access to a structured, hands-on and project-based curriculum that aligns with the real demands in tech industry presently. 
I believe AltSchool's focus on mentorship, collaboration and practical learning will help bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and professional excellence.
Currently, I work as a chemist in a pharmaceutical firm. While I appreciate the experience, it has been financially challenging, as I'm still unable to meet my basic needs comfortably. 
This has motivated me to explore opportunities in tech and not just for better financial stability, but also because of a deep curiosity and desire to understand how the web operates.
I’ve always been fascinated by how websites, mobile applications and digital platforms function behind the scenes. 
My goal is to become a skilled developer (frontend developer), contribute meaningfully to the tech space and build solutions that make an impact. I believe that with the knowledge and mentorship I’ll gain from AltSchool Africa, 
I’ll be well-equipped to transition into tech and create a better future for myself and others.
